   <li>Resistor is passive component with two leads having sum specific value of resistance. The opposition to the flow of electric current through any conducting materials is called resistance.</li> 
   <br> 
   <br> 
   <li> resistivity:-</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p1>
    The resistivity (Rho) is also called as specific resistance of that materials and it is denoted by &amp; (Rho). The specific resistance of material is defined as the resistance of materials which is 1M long and of unit cross-section area. 
  </p1> 
  <h5>EX:1 Find the resistivity and conductivity of of copper(Cu) rod who's resistance is 0.03ohm. Length is 1.5m cross-section area is 1mm 
   <p5>

  <h5>EX:2 R=0.05; l=2.5; A=1mm2</h5>

   <li><h5>conductance:</h5></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p1>
    conductance is defi8ned as the reciprocal of resistance. 
  </p1> 
  <ul> 
   <li><h5>conductivity:</h5></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p1>
    conductivity is defined as the reciprocal of resistance.

  <ul> 
   <li><h5>Electron mobility</h5></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p1>
    i) Consider the material that consist of large number of free electron. when an external electric field is absent electrons move randomly in on direction. So resulten velocity of electron is zero when we apply an external electric field of e volt per mater(e-volt/m) to such a material that free electron inside the material get accelerated I particularly direction. 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <p1>
    ii) These accelareted electron make collide with the stationary ion while travelling and does the energy. After a certain period a steady staid will be reached then at a steady velocity. This velocity is known as drift velocity. It is measured in m/s and denoted by v. 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <p1>
    The drift velocity v is proportional to applies. V*E. therefore V=/u * e. /u is proportional constant . It is define as mobility of charged particles ... /u=V\E. 
  </p1> 
  <p1>
    It is defined as mobility of electron and magnitude of average velocity. V/unit oeeuid (E) ...V/E 
  </p1> 
  <ul> 
   <li><h5>Energy level diagram of material.</h5></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p1>
    i) If iscoleted atom ðŸ’£ has a certain number of orbit available and electrons of different orbit posses different energy when it is revolving around the nucleus. 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <p1>
    ii) If we protect the energy cross ponding to the number of orbit along the positives by horizontal line then we obtain a diagram. 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <p1>
    iii) when the electron is present in the first orbit . It he said to be in it Ground State and if it is present in the higher orbits. It is said to be excited state. 
  </p1> 
  <ul> 
   <li><h5>emission of electrons from metal</h5></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p1>
    i) the Liberation of electrons from surface of an conducting material usually a metal is called electron emission 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <p1>
    ii) the valence electron within the metal can not leave the surface of metal this is have to the fact that near surface of a metal the electron experiment force to attraction pull back into Valence Electrons 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <p1>
    iii) the metal surface of has to go valence electron this is known as surface Barried type of electron emission. 1) thermal emission 2) high field emission 3) secondary emission 3) photoelectric emission. (1) thermal emission is the electron emission from a metal surface which occur by supplying thermal energy to the metal is called thermionic emission 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <p1>
    the additional energy required for this electron is supplied by heating to the metal to a sufficient high temperature usually about 2500 degree Kelvin. the Great temperature awesome metal is electron emission to the metal surface 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <p1>
    iv) as the temperature of metal in increases the electron a some energy due to which the motion of electron get accelerated these causes the electron to liberated from the surface of a metal 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <p1>
    material tungsten the reated tungsten metallic oxide of barium and tungsten electron acquire more energy (2) the electron emission from the surface of metal which (4) the stronger field higher the electron emission (5) it is used as x-raytive, Mercury as rectifier 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <ul> 
   <li><h5>secondary emission</h5></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p1>
    1. a beam of high velocity electron is made to stick a surface of metal which full the electron out of the metal surface 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <p1>
    2. in this major high velocity electron are bombarded on metallic surface to make escape electron from the metal this method is called secondary emission 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <p1>
    3. if is used in electron multiple tube CRT 
  </p1> 
  <ul> 
   <li>photoelectric emission</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p1>
    the electron emission from the metal surface illuminated by light is called photoelectric emission 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <p1>
    1. a beem of light is made to stick the surface of metal due to which electron are emitted from its surface 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <p1>
    2. the number of electrons emitted from a metal surface intensity and frequency of incident light 3. material: Sodium, Potassium , rubidium. 5. it is used in solar cell , TV, camera, photo tube, photo voltaic cell 
  </p1> 
  <ul> 
   <li>factors affecting resistivity of electrical material</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p1>
    1. temperature the resistivity of material change with temperature the electrical resistance of metal increase as well as with temperature 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <p1>
    2. alloying: this is a mixture of two aur more metal it is used to achieve some mechanical and electrical achieve the addition of small amount of impurity may increase the resistivity of metal 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <p1>
    3. cold work it is a manufacturing process used to increase the strength of metal this process increases resistivity of metal 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <ul> 
   <li><h5>effect of temperature on electrical conductivity of metal</h5></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p1>
    1. in a solid material that is metal the motion of electron consists of vibration around it in the structure 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <p1>
    2. as the temperature of metal increases the vibration are also increased as the great amount of thermal energy is converted into mechanical energy 
  </p1> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <p1>
    3. since the amount of collagen between electron and atom are affected by A vibrating motion of atom therefore the conductivity of pure metal decreases with increase in temperature of metal
